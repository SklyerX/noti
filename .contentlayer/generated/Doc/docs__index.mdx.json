    "raw": "\n## What is Noti SaaS?\n\nNoti SaaS is a self-made service that pipes notifications straight to your Discord inbox through a simple API wrapper. It turns Discord's complex notification system into something you can integrate with a few lines of code.\n\nNo fancy stuff - it's not trying to replace Discord's official notifications, A/B testing, webhooks, or logging. It just gets your important events to Discord in real-time, exactly when you need them.\n\n## Why did I make this?\n\nI was always searching for a way to get into something notification related. Even tho this project is merely a showcase of my skills I like working with notifications and external APIs which gave me an excuse. I realized that I haven't been honest about my true skills on Github for a while. Due to my heavy workload in my last year of high school I was rarely able to code and document things properly. I mostly learned coding and built small projects for fun, learning purposes, or just random tools that I needed at the time.\n\n## What's in the box ðŸ“¦\n\nTell me she's alright!! No okay but all jokes aside by box I meant the app.\n\nEven though I love this tech stack I'm starting to believe that every site is looking the same with the same technology and UI design and everything. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean these technologies aren't valuable and based on my research a lot of people are now **expecting** good developers to be familiar with them.\n\nI try to use a variety of tools and libraries in my own projects, the most random things because it's fun and I like learning. If the only tool in your toolbox is a hammer, everything is gonna look like a hammer project to you.\n\nAnyways sorry for the yapping. Here are the technologies I used in this project:\n- <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\" className=\"underline\">Next.js</a> (yeah no shit)\n- <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\" className=\"underline\">TailwindCSS</a>\n- The infamous <a href=\"https://ui.shadcn.com\" className=\"underline\">Shadcn/ui</a>\n- The greatest ORM ever made <a href=\"https://orm.drizzle.team\" className=\"underline\">DrizzleORM</a>\n- <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org\" className=\"underline\">PostgreSQL</a>\n- <a href=\"https://stripe.com\" className=\"underline\">Stripe</a>\n- <a href=\"https://contentlayer.dev\" className=\"underline\">Contentlayer</a> and <a href=\"https://mdxjs.com\" className=\"underline\">MDX</a>\n- And a bunch of other stuff that work together to make this project possible",
