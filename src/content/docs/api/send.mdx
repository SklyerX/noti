## Send a Notification

To send a notification, you need to provide the following information:

- Title
- Message (optional)
- Color (optional)
- Fields (optional)
- Metadata (optional)

These values have to be provided as the `application/json` body of the request. These fields are in compliance with the Discord API meaning anything you can do with the official API you can do with Noti SaaS.

Base URL: `https://noti.skylerx.ir/api/notification/send`

Method: `POST`

Headers:
- `x-api-key`: Your API key

<Callout>
  **Note:** The colour field is a hexadecimal color code in the format of `0xFFFFFF` (for example). You will need to provide it as this format but wrapped in a string. I know, inconvenient but thats how the discord api accepts embed colours.
